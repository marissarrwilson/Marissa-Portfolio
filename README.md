# Marissa's Portfolio

## What & Why?
This is the start to my personal portfolio, which will eventually share to my linkedin page (once it is ready). It will display the work I have done so far and show what I am capable of creating to potential employers, friends, family and those simply curious!

## Method
I made this portfolio using HTML and inline CSS. I used the same nav bar for each page which I found on Bootstrap. To activate the links within the nav bar, I included the name of each html file in the href tag for each button.

* For the "Contact" page: 
    - I used bootstrap to find a form that best fit the style I was looking for, and added padding as well as a background colour to the page

* For the "About Me" page: 
    - I created a row with col-4 and col-8, col 4 being a space for my picture and col-8 being the space for text along with my social media links. 
    - In order to scale the picture according to screen size, I included class="responsive" within the <img> tag.

* For the "Portfolio" page:
    - I created a <container> within the <body> and inserted a series of placeholder images from placeholder.com and separated them from eachother with padding and <br> tags.
